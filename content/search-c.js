Please take some time to understand this for your own safety. \ud83d\ude4f Your funds will be stolen if you do not head these warnings. We cannot recover your funds or freeze your account if you visit a phishing site or lose your private key. What is MEW? MyEtherWallet is a free, open-source, client-side interface. We allow you to interact directly with the blockchain while remaining in full control of your keys & your funds. **You** and **only you** are responsible for your security. MyEtherWallet is not a Bank MyEtherWallet is not a Bank When you open an account with a bank or exchange, they create an account for you in their system. They keep track of your personal information, account passwords, balances, transactions and ultimately your money. They charge fees to manage your account and provide services, like refunding transactions when your card gets stolen. You can write a check or charge your debit card to send money, go online to check your balance, reset your password, and get a new debit card if you lose it. You have an account *with the bank* and they decide how much money you can send, where you can send it, and how long to hold on a suspicious deposit. All for a fee. Introduction MyEtherWallet is an Interface MyEtherWallet is an Interface When you create an account here, you are generating an cryptographic set of numbers: your private key and your public key (address). The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser. We never transmit, receive or store your private key, password, or other account information. We do not charge a transaction fee. You are just using our **interface** to interact **directly with the blockchain**. If you send your *public key (address)* to someone, they can send you ETH or tokens. \ud83d\udc4d If you send your *private key* to someone, they now have full control of your account. \ud83d\udc4e MEW isn't a Bank WTF is a Blockchain? I already know what a blockchain is... Wait, WTF is a Blockchain? The blockchain is like a huge, global, decentralized spreadsheet. It keeps track of who sent how many coins to whom, and what the balance of every account is. It is stored and maintained by thousands of people (miners) across the globe who have special computers. It is made up of all the individual transactions sent from MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Exodus, Mist, Geth, Parity, and everywhere else. When you see your balance on MyEtherWallet.com or view your transactions on [etherscan.io](https:\/\/etherscan.io), you are seeing data on the blockchain, not in our personal systems. Again: we are not a bank. MEW is an Interface But...why does this matter? Why are you making me read all this? Because we need you to understand that we **cannot**... Access your account or send your funds for you. Recover or change your private key. Recover or reset your password. Reverse, cancel, or refund transactions. Freeze accounts. **You** and **only you** are responsible for your security. Be diligent to keep your private key and password safe. Your private key is sometimes called your mnemonic phrase, keystore file, UTC file, JSON file, wallet file. If lose your private key or password, no one can recover it. If you enter your private key on a phishing website, you will have **all your funds taken**. WTF is a Blockchain? What's the Point of MEW then? If MyEtherWallet can't do those things, what's the point? Because that is the point of decentralization and the blockchain. You don't have to rely on your bank, government, or anyone else when you want to move your funds. You don't have to rely on the security of an exchange or bank to keep your funds safe. If you don't find these things valuable, ask yourself why you think the blockchain and cryptocurrencies are valuable. \ud83d\ude09 If you don't like the sound of this, consider using [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) or [Blockchain.info](https:\/\/blockchain.info\/wallet\/#\/signup). They have more familiar accounts with usernames & passwords. If you are scared but want to use MEW, [get a hardware wallet](https:\/\/kb.myetherwallet.com\/hardware-wallets\/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html)! These keep your keys secure. But...why? How To Protect Yourself & Your Funds How To Protect Yourself from Phishers Phishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyEtherWallet, EtherDelta, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.

Always check the URL: `http:\/\/myetherwallet.ow`. Do not trust messages or links sent to you randomly via email, Slack, Reddit, Twitter, etc. Always navigate directly to a site before you enter information. Do not enter information after clicking a link from a message or email. [Install an AdBlocker](https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/ublock-origin\/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and do not click ads on your search engine (e.g. Google). What's the point? How To Protect Yourself from Scams How To Protect Yourself from Scams People will try to get you to give them money in return for nothing. If it is too good to be true, it probably is. Research before sending money to someone or some project. Look for information on a variety of websites and forums. Be wary. Ask questions when you don't understand something or it doesn't seem right. Don't let fear, FUD, or FOMO win over common sense. If something is very urgent, ask yourself 'why?'. It may be to create FOMO or prevent you from doing research. Phuck Phishers How To Protect Yourself from Loss How To Protect Yourself from Loss If you lose your private key or password, it is gone forever. Don't lose it. Make a backup of your private key and password. Do NOT just store it on your computer. Print it out on a piece of paper or save it to a USB drive. Store this paper or USB drive in a different physical location. A backup is not useful if it is destroyed by a fire or flood along with your laptop. Do not store your private key in Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud storage. If that account is compromised, your funds will be stolen. If you have more than 1-week's worth of pay worth of cryptocurrency, get a hardware wallet. No excuses. It's worth it. I promise.

For example, vendors are able to accept payments in multiple tokens on their e-commerce platforms yet receiving in their preferred token. In addition, dApps can allow users who are not their token holders to utilize their platform and services with other tokens, and decentralized financial projects have the means to rebalance their portfolio instantly.Open protocol to allow both contribution of liquidity sources and ultilising the on-chain liquidity pools for many different applicationsLiquidity is in turn facilitated through an open reserve architecture that allows anyone to contribute their idle token assets to our decentralized central liquidity pool and earn from the spread in every transaction. These tokens become available for use across any platform that taps into the network, making them instantly more liquid and useful.Kyber Network\u2019s protocol has been built based on 3 core design philosophies:Platform-agnosticIt is Platform-agnostic, allowing any application or protocol to be powered by our liquidity network, without limiting innovation and ecosystem diversity.Instant settlement and no transaction uncertaintyOur protocol makes real world commerce and decentralized financial products feasible by enabling instant inter-token transactions with a wide range of token options and no settlement risk, which are critical factors for many use cases.Ease of integrationKyber is built for ease of integration with different applications, as we run fully on-chain and all operations are transparent. Our key design focus is to be developer-friendly and highly compatible with other systems.In today\u2019s rapidly tokenizing world, projects are busy building innovative platforms and introducing their own token use case, without paying much attention to establishing meaningful collaboration across different entities. Bitcoin created the first cryptographic token, Ethereum took it one step further by enabling the easy tokenization of assets and creation of tokens. Consequently, there has been an explosion in the number of tokens, with each token usable only within its own isolated ecosystem.Kyber Network helps to connect all these disparate, isolated token ecosystems and makes tokens useful in a wide range of use cases. In doing so, we enable the next phase of the tokenized world.Bitcoin created the first tokenEthereum made the creation of new tokens easyKyber Network makes tokens usefulWe are committed to making our liquidity network more diverse, interoperable and scalable to power the coming needs of the space:DiversityOpening up our reserves contribution to make it seamless for anyone to be a reserve and contribute to our global liquidity pool, including funds and token teamsInteroperabilityGreater interoperability through cross-chain solutions in collaboration with other players in the ecosystem.ScalabilityScalability by continuing development on Gormos, our recently proposed high-performance scaling solution that will enable real-world adoptions for decentralized applications.Kyber Network has always been consistent in delivering our key milestones. Our team has been pioneering the development of protocols that are widely recognized as being instrumental in the development of smart contract security, sharding research, and decentralized applications.We envision a future where anyone who owns tokens, or buys into a tokenized hedge fund, can easily use these tokens in any context they want. In this future, one can use gold-backed tokens to buy a T-shirt in a matter of seconds, invest in alternative funds in a completely different part of the world or use tokenized real estate to buy jewellery for a loved one.When such seamless cross-border and cross-platform value flow is eventually possible, Kyber Network would have taken a major step towards making the promise of a truly decentralized world a reality.Who we areLoi LuuCEOYaron VelnerCTOVictor TranHead of DevelopmentMyra LohCFOSunny JainHead of ProductBo-yeon BeonMarketing ManagerShane HongContent Marketing ManagerDeniz OmerCommunity EvangelistLucas HuangChina Community ManagerDaisy NguyenVietnam Marketing LeadPeter NguyenCustomer Support LeadDiep PhamTechnical ManagerAndrew NguyenTechnical ManagerNam NguyenTechnical LeadTu LuuTest LeadTal BenethTechnical LeadSpyros VrettosTrading Analyst \/ DeveloperIlan DoronDeveloperDuc TranDeveloperDesmond HoDeveloperAnton BuenavistaDeveloperSimon TanDeveloperShow MoreOur AdvisorsWong Lee HongExecutive AdvisorVitalik ButerinAdvisorLeng Hoe LonExecutive AdvisorChionh Chye KitAdvisorKenneth OhAdvisorPrateek SaxenaAdvisorJohn Ng PangilinanAdvisorPandia JiangAdvisorSimon KimAdvisorHwisang KimCountry RepresentativeOur PartnersMeet the reputable partners helping us power decentralized liquidity for the tokenized worldTRUST WALLETCOINMANAGERCIPHERIMTOKENRIPIO CREDIT NETWORKOLYMPUS LABETHLENDICONMELONPORTGIFTOCOINDUCKSTORMAPPCOINSADITUSWANCHAINREQUEST NETWORKBLOCKCHAIN AT BERKELEYENIGMATRACETO.IOCYNOPSIS SOLUTIONSSPARROW EXCHANGEWAXMY ETHER WALLETTOSHISupported byHYPERCHAIN CAPITALPANTERAFENBUSHI CAPITALKENETIC CAPITALFBGDANHUA CAPITALHASHEDSIGNUM CAPITALLike what we are building?Please subscribe to our mailing list for updates from us and our partnersSubscribeKyberDeveloperAboutKyber NetworkKNCBlogCommunityFAQContact UsMedia KitTracker@ 2018 Kyber Network.

Kyber Network charges transaction fees, in KNC, from these reserves.DApps \/ Wallets \/ VendorsEntities that leverage on our liquidity networkBy registering and plugging into our liquidity network, DApps (decentralized applications) and businesses earn commission in KNC after every transaction that they facilitate in Kyber Network. For instance, a DApp platform integrated with our APIs will receive referral fees in KNC for directing more users to our network and helping us generate greater adoption.Network FeesIn each transaction, a portion of the collected fees (in KNC) on Kyber Network are taken out of circulation forever.Where you can buy KNCBithumbKNC\/KRWHuobiKNC\/ETH, BTCBinanceKKNC\/ETH, BTCKyber NetworkKNC\/ETHOKExKNC\/ETH, BTC, USDTLiquiKNC\/ETH, BTC, USDTSee allLike what we are building?Please subscribe to our mailing list for updates from us and our partnersSubscribeKyberDeveloperAboutKyber NetworkKNCBlogCommunityFAQContact UsMedia KitTracker@ 2018 Kyber Network.

Transforming the way individual ideas shape collective action. Making mindful leadership the new standard. Our Mission We empower communities with decision making tools that inspire trust. We believe open dialogue is the foundation of an empowered community. To inform better collective decision making our platform supports, connects and values every voice with integrity. We believe open dialogue is the foundation of an empowered community within business and government, and that there\u2019s a better way to identify points of contention and measure consensus with integrity. A New Way Forward Organisations typically operate in a centralised and hierarchical structure. They often provide generalised solutions that are not sufficiently tailored to the specific set of needs faced by those they are trying to help. This traditional approach tends to be an arm's length solution that is at odds with the more communal, decentralised or distributed pattern of engagement that is increasingly intuitive and natural in our highly connected world. The Horizon State Promise Horizon State has identified the need for organisations to move towards a more inclusive and responsive engagement style as being a significant contributing factor to the abandonment of many promising digital transformation projects. While organisations often do their best to engage their customers and members, they are hampered by having to work with an outdated set of tools and processes, which often results in a lack of trust and necessary buy-in required for genuine community input and end-user engagement to achieve broader organisational goals. The platform is based on three core pillars Organisations that are enabled to be more responsive and interactive in their engagement with members, providing improved services, information and secure community interactions. Members who are empowered to interact and benefit from improved services offered by organisations in order to effectively engage with other members in community contexts, and to benefit from the services offered by multiple providers. Citizen-led service providers who supply the industry solutions and financial infrastructure that augment and enable the interactions between organisations and their members, with services available for private use between members. Through deeper engagement, organisations will have a clearer understanding of the needs of both their customers and staff allowing them to provide meaningful services and genuine solutions. With easy access to the right services, members are better served by their communities and organisations. All this is done in a manner where the platform ensures protection of individual identities, giving smaller voices the opportunity for expression where they might otherwise not be heard. .footerSocial { width: 32px; height: 32px; display: inline-block; border: 1px solid #fff; -webkit-border-radius: 50%; -moz-border-radius: 50%; border-radius: 50%; margin-right: 15px; background-size: 16px 16px; background-position: center; background-repeat: no-repeat; } .footerSocial.twitter { background-image: url(\/assets\/img\/twitter-white.svg); } .footerSocial.reddit { background-image: url(\/assets\/img\/reddit-white.svg); } .footerSocial.telegram { background-image: url(\/assets\/img\/telegram-white.svg); } .footerSocial.linkedin { background-image: url(\/assets\/img\/linkedin-white.svg); } .footerSocial.facebook { background-image: url(\/assets\/img\/facebook-white.svg); } .footerSocial:hover { background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.2); } Find out how Horizon State can drive your organisation forward Contact us Ensuring every voice counts.

Secure ZEN is the first cryptocurrency with fully end-to-end encryption at the node and internode level. In addition to zk-SNARKs, the Horizen architecture includes encryption at the node level. Cryptocurrencies rely on nodes to operate, we require our Secure Node operators to have the latest Information Technology and Network Security to qualify for compensation. Untraceable Shielded transactions are fully encrypted, yet can be verified as valid under the network\u2019s consensus. The sender, recipient, and amount are hidden on the blockchain, making Horizen completely untraceable. Domain fronting is a versatile censorship circumvention technique that hides the remote endpoint of a communication. It works at the application layer, using HTTPS, to communicate with a forbidden host while appearing to communicate with some other host, permitted by the censor. The key idea is the use of different domain names at different layers of communication. One domain appears on the \u201coutside\u201d of an HTTPS request\u2013in the 9 DNS request and TLS Server Name Indication, while another domain appears on the \u201cinside\u201d\u2013in the HTTP Host header, invisible to the censor under HTTPS encryption. A censor, unable to distinguish fronted and non-fronted traffic to a domain, must choose between allowing circumvention traffic and blocking the domain entirely, which results in expensive collateral damage. Domain fronting does not require special cooperation by network intermediaries. We identify a number of hard-to-block web services, such as content delivery networks, that support domain-fronted connections and are useful for censorship circumvention. Resilient Horizen has one of the most distributed node systems. Learn more about Secure Nodes! Learn more about Secure Nodes and Super Nodes Horizen Secure Nodes enable a distributed and reliable cryptocurrency system that encrypts inter-node communications. Horizen node communication looks like any other encrypted internet traffic, instead of like Bitcoin traffic. This effectively hides the type of activity taking place, making it less likely that Horizen users and nodes are blocked.

Districts are marketplaces and communities that exist as decentralized autonomous organizations on the district0x Network. All internet citizens will be able to deploy districts to the network free of charge, forever. All districts possess the following core functionalities... Posting & listing Search & filtering Ranking & reputation Payments & invoicing district0x Network Token d0xINFRA EthereumSmart Contracts &Libraries District-specificSmartContracts District-specificFront-End AragonGovernance Web3.js d0xINFRA Front-End Libraries IPFS File Storage The d0xINFRA Framework At the core of every district is the d0xINFRA framework, a stack of Ethereum smart contracts and front-end libraries distributed on IPFS which power a district's basic functionalities. d0xINFRA is designed to be open and extendable, allowing districts to implement unique features and enhanced functionality via the plug-in of auxiliary modules. Governance by Aragon Aragon is a revolutionary new platform for the deployment of unstoppable virtual organizations and entities. The creation of a district on the district0x Network will establish an accompanying Aragon entity, where all of the district\u2019s governance and decision making processes will be executed. Districts Powered By district0x Ethlance Launched in January 2017, Ethlance is a decentralized job market for everyone from freelancers to full-time career seekers alike. Ethlance is the first district on the district0x network and will operate in perpetuity. Name Bazaar Launched in October 2017, Name Bazaar is a peer-to-peer marketplace for the exchange of names registered via the Ethereum Name Service, providing an easily discoverable registry of ENS names available for purchase. Meme Factory The third district to be deployed, Meme Factory will provide an interface for the creation of provably rare digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain which can be immediately posted to a bulletin board-style marketplace for exchange. Future district0x Projects The district0x Project team will continue to deploy districts to the district0x Network indefinitely, simultaneously serving as sandboxes for the refinement of the d0xINFRA framework while showcasing the powers of decentralized markets and communities. Your Very Own District Upon deployment of the district creation platform, all internet citizens will be able to quickly launch districts on the district0x Network. Powered by the decentralized web, district0x provides the liberty to build, free from censorship and intermediaries.

The district0x Network Token is a multi-utility token which is required for application to the district0x Network, utilized in an incentivized voting game to dictate access to a suite of ancillary services exclusive to network members, used to signal support or disapproval for proposals made by network participants, and which can be staked to deposit pools to mint tokens providing district-specific voting rights on third-party platforms such as Aragon. Voting rights can be used to partake in the processes that determine everything from a district's design and branding, to its functionality, to its accepted code of conduct, to the integrations it utilizes, and beyond. What Should We Build Next? We encourage and incentivize the submission of marketplace ideas via an open community proposal process. The district0x Network Token allows holders to signal for what markets they would like to see the district0x team build and deploy to the network next. Vote For the Next Districts The District Registry The District Registry is a decentrally maintained district whitelist, storing the credentials of districts which have been granted access to the district0x Network. Based on an incentivized voting game called a Token-Curated Registry, inclusion of a district in the District Registry signifies that the district has been accredited by district0x Network Token holders as non-malicious and value-additive to the district0x Network.

White Paper Vote For the Next Districts Twitter Medium Github hello@district0x.io Frequently Asked QuestionsFAQ district0x Network What is district0x? The district0x network is a collective of decentralized marketplaces and communities known as \u2018Districts\u2019. Districts exist on top of a modular framework of Ethereum smart contracts and frontend libraries referred to as d0xINFRA. What problem does district0x solve? The district0x network solves a number of coordination issues and inefficiencies commonly found within distributed community marketplaces. This is accomplished by providing tools that can better align incentives and decision making among the market participants themselves. The end goal is to create a self sustaining ecosystem that can flourish without the need for a central authority. What is d0xINFRA? d0xINFRA is a standard open source framework comprised of Ethereum smart contracts and front-end libraries. With the development of Name Bazaar and Meme Factory, the district0x team is building the initial iteration of d0xINFRA, which will allow other development teams to launch their very own district. How do you pronounce district0x? District - Zero - X How do you pronounce d0xINFRA? D - Zero - X - Infra Why the name district0x? The name district0x is derived from two things. \"Districts\" are the marketplaces and communities that serve as building blocks of the network. \"0x\" is an homage to the Ethereum network as the first two symbols that make up all Ethereum addresses. The \"0x\" prefix is used throughout computer science as the beginning of hash values. Where can I find a development roadmap? Visit our blog for the most up to date information regarding our roadmap, and view our blog posts for announcements and development updates. Districts What are districts? Districts are the decentralized community marketplaces that utilize the d0xINFRA framework. They are managed by a governance layer provided by the Aragon network, operating through Ethereum smart contracts and our standardized front-end libraries (d0xINFRA). What will districts look like? Districts will be able to look completely unique from one another. We primarily design libraries so they don\u2019t dictate the visual side of things, but there will also be layers on top of that with pre-made, customizable components for optional use. We\u2019ll be using those components in our districts. Currently we've chosen the Material Design style for these components, as can be seen on Ethlance. This may change over time if a better solution presents itself. What will the first district on the district0x network be? Ethlance is the first launched district, and was deployed to the Ethereum Mainnet on January 29, 2017. This was followed by Name Bazaar, deployed to the Ethereum Mainnet on October 24th, 2017. In the future, we will build and deploy Meme Factory. The fourth district to be built on the network is currently being decided by token holders on the district0x Voting dApp. What kind of project could implement a district? We envision virtually any type of communal marketplace being built as a district. If the project requires the ability to post listings, search\/filter through listings, rank or give reputation to users, and\/or allow for payments; then they should be a good fit for a district. A current list of district proposals can be found here. Is there a fee to create a district or become part of the network? No, there is no fee planned to create a district or join the network. However, joining the network will require a refundable deposit to the District Registry. This deposit may be challenged and forfeited in the event that the district is considered malicious or does not add value in the eyes of the network participants. What are auxiliary modules? An auxiliary module is a piece of software that can be added to a district that extends functionality or adds new features that the marketplace participants can utilize. Auxiliary modules are intended to facilitate the modular and extensible nature of the network, allowing each district and its participants to elect the functionality that district offers. Governance How does a project become part of the network? The district0x token holders themselves decide whether a district is good or bad for the network through the District Registry, an incentivized voting game that dictates access to the network. Whether a district is good or bad not only applies in terms of the quality of the marketplace, but also prevents against districts that are deemed immoral or threatening to the entire network by DNT holders. This will be entirely up to the DNT token holders to decide. How will district governance work? When a marketplace is created on the district0x Network, a corresponding Aragon entity will be created, where all of the marketplace\u2019s governance processes will occur. To facilitate open participation in these governance processes for all internet citizens, DNT allows holders to stake their tokens to a district in exchange for voting shares in its Aragon entity. Voting shares will be used to come to consensus on everything from a district\u2019s code of conduct, to the ways in which they choose to monetize, to how any revenue generated is utilized or distributed. What is the District Registry? The District Registry is based on an incentivized voting game developed by the Token-Curated Registry team at Consensys. At its core, a Token-Curated Registry (TCR) allows for a community of token holders to curate a list for a number of different purposes. Those purposes could include anything from access to a \u201cclean pool\u201d of resources, a guest list, content curation, fraud prevention, among many other uses that increase the quality of anything entering a list. This is accomplished through a deposit, challenge, vote and reveal process. The specific purpose of the District Registry is to democratize many of the decision making and governance processes to DNT holders. You can learn more about TCRs here. Can a district implement their own token? Yes, there are scenarios where a district can create its own token to provide some additional utility outside of governance purposes. Many projects that have submitted a proposal in our Github have already created a token that provides market specific utility. Who gets voting rights in a district? The creator of the district has voting rights initially. As a result, they could set their bylaws so they retain complete control over the district. However, this would be disadvantageous for them if trying to develop a large and active district. But in some cases, it may be preferable. Why should a project utilize d0xINFRA? If a project implements the d0xINFRA framework, it will ensure compatibility with all future auxiliary modules on the marketplace layer as well as any apps\/modules deployed to the Aragon governance layer. This modular standardization will ensure all marketplaces on the network can remain nimble, flexible to change and seamlessly co-operate in the most efficient way possible. district0x Network Token (DNT) What is the District Network Token? The district0x Network Token is an Ethereum-based token built using the ERC20 standard. This token was created to facilitate participation and coordination in the development of the district0x Network, and eventually the handoff of network governance to the community. What is the value proposition of DNT? The district0x Network Token is a multi-utility token required for application to the District Registry, an incentivized voting game to dictate access to a suite of supplementary services exclusive to network members. It\u2019s also used to signal support or disapproval for proposals made by network participants, and will be staked to deposit pools to mint tokens providing district-specific voting rights in corresponding Aragon entities. The inherent value to any given person will differ depending on the extent of their desire to participate in the network as well as the mechanisms outlined in our whitepaper. How does the DNT staking mechanism work? A refundable deposit of DNT can be deposited to a district\u2019s corresponding Aragon entity. By doing so, an individual is granted voting rights in the form of tokens that can only be used within that specific Aragon entity. An individual can then use those tokens to propose and vote on anything ranging from a district\u2019s branding and design decisions, to what functionality is added via auxiliary modules, to the appropriate settings for any adjustable parameters of these modules, to the means in which any revenue collected by a district is to be distributed, and beyond. Will staking DNT to a district provide passive rewards similar to proof of stake? Unlike \u201cproof of stake\u201d and other reward based staking schemes, DNT does not provide a direct reward when staking your DNT to a district. These types of incentive structures would be up to governance participants proposing and voting for changes within an individual district\u2019s Aragon entity. Why can't spend DNT in a district? We will never enforce the use of DNT for payments on the platform, we intend to allow for payment not only in ETH, but any other ERC20 by leveraging the 0x Protocol. For some background on the logic for this, refer to our blog post about the 0x integration. district0x Network Fundraiser When was the network fundraiser? The fundraiser began on 7\/18\/2017 and ran through 08\/1\/2017. What is the total supply of district0x Network Tokens? A total of 1 billion tokens were minted by the district0x Genesis Contract. 600 million DNT were distributed to fundraiser participants during the initial contribution period which ended on August 1, 2017. 180 million DNT are held in reserve for possible future fundraisers. 198 million DNT are held by district0x founders, and are subject to a 2 year vesting schedule. The remaining 22 million DNT are reserved for advisors and the community rewards program. Will there be a lockup period for tokens allocated to the founding team? Tokens distributed to founders, early contributors, and advisors vest are subject to a vesting schedule. Founder and advisor tokens are allocated over a 24-month vesting period, with a 6-month cliff. Early contributor tokens are allocated over a 6-month vesting period, with a 3-month cliff.

The user acknowledges that the user has an adequate understanding of the risks, usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based open source software, eth platform and ethereum The user acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable law, the disclaimers of liability contained herein apply to any and all damages or injury whatsoever caused by or related to risks of, use of, or inability to use, ethereum or the Ethereum platform under any cause or action whatsoever of any kind in any jurisdiction, including, without limitation, actions for breach of warranty, breach of contract or tort (including negligence) and that neither Stiftung Ethereum (i.e. Ethereum Foundation) nor Ethereum team shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including for loss of profits, goodwill or data that occurs as a result. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Therefore, some of the above limitations in this section may not apply to a user. In particular, nothing in these terms shall affect the statutory rights of any user or exclude injury arising from any willful misconduct or fraud of Stiftung Ethereum. LONG VERSION The following Terms and Conditions (\u201cTerms\u201d) govern the use of the Ethereum open source software platform (\u201cEthereum Platform\u201d). Prior to any use of the Ethereum Platform, the User confirms to understand and expressly agrees to all of the Terms. All capitalized terms in this agreement will be given the same effect and meaning as in the Terms. The group of developers and other personnel that is now, or will be, employed by, or contracted with, Stiftung Ethereum (\u201cStiftung Ethereum\u201d) is termed the \u201cEthereum Team.\u201d The Platform will be developed by persons and entities who support Ethereum, including both volunteers and developers who are paid by nonprofit entities interested in supporting the Ethereum Platform. The user acknowledges the following serious risks to any use the Ethereum Platform and ETH and expressly agrees to neither hold Ethereum Stiftung nor the Ethereum Team liable should any of the following risks occur: Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions The Ethereum Platform and ETH could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Stiftung Ethereum to continue to develop the Ethereum Platform, or which could impede or limit the ability of a User to use Ethereum Platform or ETH. Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Ethereum Networks It is possible that alternative Ethereum-based networks could be established, which utilize the same open source source code and open source protocol underlying the Ethereum Platform. The Ethereum network may compete with these alternative Ethereum-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Ethereum Platform and ETH. Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Ethereum Platform or Distributed Applications It is possible that the Ethereum Platform will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Ethereum Platform and potential uses of ETH. It cannot predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third parties. Risk that the Ethereum Platform, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of User The User recognizes that the Ethereum Platform is under development and may undergo significant changes before release. The User acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Ethereum Platform held by the User may not be met upon release of the Ethereum Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the Ethereum Platform. Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Ethereum Platform Core Infrastructure Software The Ethereum Platform rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the Ethereum Stiftung or the Ethereum Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the Stiftung Ethereum, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Ethereum Platform causing the system to lose ETH stored in one or more User accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the Ethereum Platform. Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of ETH. To the extent possible, Stiftung Ethereum intends to update the protocol underlying the Ethereum Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner. Risk of Ether Mining Attacks As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Ethereum Platform is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to: Double-spend attacks Majority mining power attacks, \u201cSelfish-mining\u201d attacks Race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Ethereum Platform, expected proper execution and sequencing of ETH transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Despite the efforts of the Ethereum Stiftung and Team, known or novel mining attacks may be successful. Risk of Rapid Adoption and Increased Demand If the Ethereum Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for ETH could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ETH miners can create new ETH tokens. Under such a scenario, the entire Ethereum Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Ethereum Platform and ETH. Instability in the demand of for ETH may lead to a negative change of the economical parameters of an Ethereum based business which could result in the business being unable to continue to operate economically or to cease operation. Risk of Rapid Adoption and Insufficiency of Computational Application Processing Power on the Ethereum Platform If the Ethereum Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing and distributed application computations could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ETH miners can bring online additional mining power. Under such a scenario, the entire Ethereum Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Ethereum Platform and ETH. Insufficiency of computational resources and an associated rise in the price of ETH could result in businesses being unable to acquire scarce computational resources to run their distributed applications. This would represent revenue losses to businesses or worst case, cause businesses to cease operations because such operations have become uneconomical due to distortions in the crypto-economy. Acknowledgment, Acceptance of all Risks and Disclaimer of Warranties and Liabilities THE USER EXPRESSLY KNOWS AND AGREES THAT THE USER IS USING THE Ethereum PLATFORM AT THE USER\u2019S SOLE RISK. THE USER REPRESENTS THAT THE USER HAS AN ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS, USAGES AND INTRICACIES OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, ETH PLATFORM AND ETH. THE USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO RISKS OF, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, ETH OR THE Ethereum PLATFORM UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT NEITHER Stiftung Ethereum NOR ETHEREUM TEAM SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO A USER. IN PARTICULAR, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL AFFECT THE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF ANY USER OR EXCLUDE INJURY ARISING FROM ANY WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD OF Stiftung Ethereum. Risk of temporary network incoherence We recommend any groups handling large or important transactions to maintain a voluntary 24 hour waiting period on any ether deposited. In case the integrity of the network is at risk due to issues in the clients, we will endeavor to publish patches in a timely fashion to address the issues. We will endeavour to provide solutions within the voluntary 24 hour waiting period. Dispute Resolution All disputes or claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms, the breach thereof, or use of the Ethereum Platform shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with said Rules. All claims between the parties relating to these Terms that are capable of being resolved by arbitration, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be submitted to ICC arbitration. Prior to commencing arbitration, the parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their dispute in a manner other than by submission to ICC arbitration. The arbitration panel shall consist of one arbitrator only, unless the ICC Court of Arbitration determines that the dispute is such as to warrant three arbitrators. If the Court determines that one arbitrator is sufficient, then such arbitrator shall be Swiss resident. If the Court determines that three arbitrators are necessary, then each party shall have 30 days to nominate an arbitrator of its choice -- in the case of the Claimant, measured from receipt of notification of the ICC Court\u2019s decision to have three arbitrators; in the case of Respondent, measured from receipt of notification of Claimant\u2019s nomination. All nominations must be Swiss resident. If a party fails to nominate an arbitrator, the Court will do so. The Court shall also appoint the chairman. All arbitrators shall be and remain \u201cindependent\u201d of the parties involved in the arbitration. The place of arbitration shall be Zug, Switzerland. The language of the arbitration shall be English. In deciding the merits of the dispute, the tribunal shall apply the laws of Switzerland and any discovery shall be limited and shall not involve any depositions or any other examinations outside of a formal hearing. The tribunal shall not assume the powers of amiable compositeur or decide the case ex aequo et bono. In the final award, the tribunal shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties shall bear such costs in what proportion. Every award shall be binding on the parties. The parties undertake to carry out the award without delay and waive their right to any form of recourse against the award in so far as such waiver can validly be made. Force Majeure Stiftung Ethereum is finally not liable for: Unavoidable casualty Delays in delivery of materials Embargoes Government orders Acts of civil or military authorities Lack of energy Any similar unforeseen event that renders performance commercially implausible. Mmmm nevermind...Sure I understand and agree Build unstoppable applications Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middleman or counterparty risk. The project was bootstrapped via an ether presale in August 2014 by fans all around the world. It is developed by the Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss non-profit, with contributions from great minds across the globe. On traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its own servers that run their own code in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard. If a single app is compromised or goes offline, many users and other apps are affected. On a blockchain, anyone can set up a node that replicates the necessary data for all nodes to reach an agreement and be compensated by users and app developers. This allows user data to remain private and apps to be decentralized like the Internet was supposed to work. Smart money, smart wallet The Ethereum Wallet is a gateway to decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows you to hold and secure ether and other crypto-assets built on Ethereum, as well as write, deploy and use smart contracts.DownloadEthereum Wallet for Mac OS X Download Ethereum Wallet for Windows 64 bitsDownload Ethereum Wallet for Windows 32 bits (requires Command Line tools) Download Ethereum Wallet for LinuxDownload Ethereum Wallet (Windows 64 bits, Linux and OS X) See all versions Hold ether or any Ethereum-based token in safe wallets Easy template-based contract creation Your accessible interface to blockchain applications EthereumJoin the CommunityDonate Learn Solidity, a new language for smart contracts Design and issue your own cryptocurrency Create a tradeable digital token that can be used as a currency, a representation of an asset, a virtual share, a proof of membership or anything at all. These tokens use a standard coin API so your contract will be automatically compatible with any wallet, other contract or exchange also using this standard. The total amount of tokens in circulation can be set to a simple fixed amount or fluctuate based on any programmed ruleset. Issue your token You can build: A tradeable token with a fixed supply A central bank that can issue money A puzzle-based cryptocurrency Kickstart a project with a trustless crowdsale Do you already have ideas that you want to develop on Ethereum? Maybe you need help and some funds to bring them to life, but who would lend money to someone they don\u2019t trust? Using Ethereum, you can create a contract that will hold a contributor's money until any given date or goal is reached. Depending on the outcome, the funds will either be released to the project owners or safely returned back to the contributors. All of this is possible without requiring a centralized arbitrator, clearinghouse or having to trust anyone. You can even use the token you created earlier to keep track of the distribution of rewards. Kickstart your project You can build: A crowdfund to pre-sell a product A crowdsale to sell virtual shares in a blockchain organization An auction of a limited number of items Create a democratic autonomous organization Now that you have developed your idea and secured funds, what\u2019s next? You have to hire managers, find a trustworthy CFO to handle the accounts, run board meetings and do a bunch of paperwork. Or you can simply leave all that to an Ethereum contract. It will collect proposals from your backers and submit them through a completely transparent voting process. One of the many advantages of having a robot run your organization is that it is immune to any outside influence as it\u2019s guaranteed to execute only what it was programmed to. And because the Ethereum network is decentralized, you'll be able to provide services with a 100% uptime guarantee. Start your organization You can build: A virtual organization where members vote on issues A transparent association based on shareholder voting Your own country with an unchangeable constitution A better delegative democracy Build a new kind of decentralized application Now it's your turn: start building what you dream of creating in Ethereum! Could your business be enhanced by operating on a cryptographically secure, decentralized, tamper-proof network? Check out the many great projects* already being built on Ethereum. And since you'll be among the first developers in the world that are able to program decentralized applications, some of them might need your help. *The above list is maintained by an independent party and the Foundation does not endorse its content or any particular project Get the command line tools If you feel more comfortable around a terminal, you can download our command line tools.

This is what makes BTCP unique Private Bitcoin Private uses the same privacy technology as ZClassic (zk-snarks). This means payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient and other transactional metadata remain unidentifiable. Open Source Bitcoin Private's entire codebase is publicly available for viewing and verification by anyone. It will always remain open source and be maintained by an ever growing community. Decentralized Just like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Private supports peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public ledger. Fast Unlike Bitcoin, Bitcoin Private supports a slightly increased block size while being more anonymous and secure than any existing Bitcoin-based currency without sacrificing transaction speeds. Community Driven In the nature of transparency and open source, Bitcoin Private is developed by team members all over the world. Each member fills roles and contributes based on his or her skill sets. A Fair Start There was no premine, and there is no founder's reward. Bitcoin Private has been released in a fair manner to all.

It utilizes blockchain technology and digital identities to digitize assets and automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts. Using a distributed network, it aims to create a \"Smart Economy\". NEO was founded in 2014 and open sourced on GitHub in June 2015. Its MainNet was released in October 2016 and has been running in stable capacity for two years. Its vision of a \"smart economy\" was set up along with the project rebranding in 2017.NEO is committed to its goal of being the most developer-friendly public chain: \ud83e\udd47 Infrastructure friendliness: a comprehensive toolkit for underlying infrastructure development; a mature NeoContract system; multi mainstream programming language support in NeoVM \ud83e\udd47 Community friendliness: a global map of developer communities, distributed in the US, Europe, Japan and Korea, etc.; active community voices from social media \ud83e\udd47 Ecosystem friendliness: NGD and NGC, as execution and investment arms of NEO Foundation provide technical support, advertising campaigns and funding for eco-projects; nearly 100 dApps within NEO ecosystem The underlying infrastructure of NEO supports multiple types of digital assets. Users can register, transfer and trade assets at their own discretion on NEO. Digital certificates are supported to build trust into the public chain. This provides full legal protection for all assets digitized through the NEO platform. Facilitate P2P trustless exchange of digital assets. Buyers and sellers of digital assets and currencies will be matched peer-to-peer without the need for third party exchanges. Turing-complete smart contract, which has high certainty and finality, support concurrent operation, sharding and unlimited scalability when running in NeoVM. NeoContract supports multiple programming languages such as C#, Java, and Python. Developers can rapidly develop smart contracts based on the NEO platform without learning a unique language. Neo Virtual Machine (NeoVM) - NEO's lightweight stack-based virtual machine provides shorter startup times with efficient execution. Deterministic calling tree-technology allows NEO to achieve theoretically unlimited scalability. Consensus nodes use Byzantine Fault Tolerance Algorithm to reach consensus and ensure the finality of transactions. It also ensures that the system keeps its finality and availability as long as Byzantine fault occurs on less than 1\/3 of the nodes. Comprises Cross-chain Assets Swap Protocol and Cross-chain Distributed Transaction Protocol and can achieve atomic assets\u00a0swap and guarantee the operation consistency of smart contracts executed on different chains. Introduced Lattice cryptography-based signing and encryption technique to avoid quantum crisis by Turing encryption\u00a0and\u00a0decryption problem into the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), which cannot be solved by current quantum computers. NEO Client The NEO Team and community have created various wallets for different platforms. You can download the wallets or access the web wallets below. Go to client page If you are a developer NeoContract supports multiple programming languages such as C#, Java, and Python.

Everyone who find the vulnerabilities can send email to erik@neo.org. We will try our best to investigate those eligible vulnerabilities and fix the valid issues. All rewards will be paid in the equivalent amount of NEO. Note: Higher rewards will be paid out in case of vulnerabilities of certain interest and criticality. Before reporting any issues, please check the following disclosures on responsibilities, program rules and reporting manner notice. Program Rules Level of vulnerabilities will undergo evaluation by the NEO R&D team based on severity, influence and other dimensions. As we will prioritize report assessment by risks and other factors, it may take time for our response. Time to first response (from report submission) will be 5 business days; time to triage (from report submission) will be 10 business days. NEO will regularly update the feedback on its website and social media channels. Rewards will be distributed within 3 days following official announcement. NEO reserves the right of final interpretation of the event. To finally achieve the self-worthy reward the submitters should abide by the following event rules: Only issues related to stability and security with design and implementation is within the scope, vulnerabilities with NEO website and related infrastructure on the NEO blockchain is out of the scope. Find more details at the Scope of Bug Bounty Program. Submitted reports should contain detailed reproduction procedures, in the absence of which, the reports will be excluded from the rewarding list. The more detailed about the proof of vulnerabilities and the descriptions are, the higher your reward will be. For those who report the same vulnerability, the reward goes to whom comes first. Serial vulnerabilities caused by one vulnerability will be considered as one vulnerability, e.g., a series of computing errors caused by data overflow. Vulnerabilities fitting in any of the following descriptions will not be eligible for the rewards: Those published or known ones are not eligible for rewards. If you unveil such vulnerabilities before NEO fixes or publish them, the reward becomes null and void. Participants who use submitted vulnerabilities to damage NEO ecosystem, infringe on users' interest and perform pilferage on users' assets will be disqualified for rewards; meanwhile, NEO is rightful to resort to justice.

Data relating to You, We may not be in the position to provide some or all of the services You expect from Us or even to guarantee the full functionality of Our Site.SPECIAL NOTE ON CONSENTFor the avoidance of all doubt, We would like to point out that in those limited cases where We cannot or choose not to rely on another legal ground (for example, Our legitimate interests), We will process Your Personal Data on the basis of Your consent. In some cases, We will require Your explicit consent, for example, when, on the basis of Your explicit consent We will process special categories of data concerning You such as Your health data (for example when informing Us about a disability such as colour blindness).In those cases where We process on the basis of Your consent (which We will never presume but which We shall have obtained in a clear and manifest manner from You),YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT AT ANY TIME and this, in the same manner as You shall have provided it to Us.Should You exercise Your right to withdraw Your consent at any time (by writing to Us at the physical or email address below), We will determine whether at that stage an alternative legal basis exists for processing Your Personal Data (for example, on the basis of a legal obligation to which We are subject) where We would be legally authorised (or even obliged) to process Your Personal Data without needing Your consent and if so, notify You accordingly.When We ask for such Personal Data, You may always decline, however should You decline to provide Us with necessary data that We require to provide requested services, We may not necessarily be able to provide You with such services (especially if consent is the only legal ground that is available to Us).Just to clarify, consent is not the only ground that permits Us to process Your Personal Data. In the last preceding section above We pointed out the various grounds that We rely on when processing Your Personal Data for specific purposes.ACCURACY OF PERSONAL DATAAll reasonable efforts are made to keep any Personal Data We may hold about You up-to-date and as accurate as possible. You can check the information that We hold about You at any time by contacting Us in the manner explained below. If You find any inaccuracies, We will correct them and where required, delete them as necessary. Please see below for a detailed list of Your legal rights in terms of any applicable data protection law.DIRECT MARKETINGWe only send mail, messages and other communications relating to marketing where We are authorised to do so at law. In most cases We rely on Your consent to do so (especially where We use electronic communications). If, at any time, You no longer wish to receive direct marketing communications from Us please let Us know by contacting Us at the details below or update Your preferences on any of Our Site(s) or Apps (where applicable).In the case of direct marketing sent by electronic communications (where We are legally authorised to do so) You will be given an easy way of opting out (or unsubscribing) from any such communications.Please note that even if You withdraw any consent You may have given Us or if You object to receiving such direct marketing material from Us (in those cases where We do not need Your consent), from time to time We may still need to send You certain important communications from which You cannot opt-out.TRANSFERS TO THIRD COUNTRIESAs a general rule, the data We process about You (collected via the Site, any of our Apps or otherwise) will be stored and processed within the European Union (EU)\/European Economic Area (EEA) or any other non-EEA country deemed by the European Commission to offer an adequate level of protection (the so-called \u2018white-listed\u2019 countries listed here: https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/law\/law-topic\/data-protection_en).In some cases, it may be necessary for Us to transfer Your Personal Data to a non-EEA country not considered by the European Commission to offer an adequate level of protection (for example to one or more of Our data processors located there). For example, for the implementation of Your desired transaction it can be necessary that We disclose Your Personal Data to banks or other entities outside the EEA.In such cases, apart from all appropriate safeguards that We implement, in any case, to protect Your Personal Data, We have put in place additional adequate measures. For example, We have ensured that the recipient is bound by the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (the EU Model Clauses) designed to protect Your Personal Data as though it were an intra-EEA transfer. You are entitled to obtain a copy of these measures by contacting Us as explained below.INTERNET COMMUNICATIONSYou will be aware that data sent via the Internet may be transmitted across international borders even where sender and receiver of information are located in the same country.

Yes, OpenWeb Network is powered by smart contracts and all the operations are handled by blockchain powered smart contracts. All the operations including host registration, content publishing, payments, staking etc are handled by Ethereum based smart contracts. What is staking? Staking allows anyone to support trusted hosts on the network. Host rewards are based on staking which will create healthy competition in the network among hosts to provide better quality service to the users. Stakeholders earn monthly rewards in OWT tokens for supporting the ecosystem. How is data integrity ensured in OpenWeb? OpenWeb Network includes hashing algorithm to ensure integrity of data published on the Network. The hash of the website is calculated every time a website is published on the network. When a user requests website from the host, OpenWeb extension check if the website hash in the smart contract matches with the website hash delivered by the host before displaying the website to the user. How to become a Host? The host registration can be done either through OpenWeb Network Website or through OpenWeb Network smart contract. To complete registration through smart contract the host needs to send host node connection details (IP:Port) to register host function in the smart contract. OpenWeb Website has included a user friendly registration process which will enable anyone to setup host nodes on the network. Blockchain powered, decentralised, open source website network.

It\u2019s complementary to the Ethereum blockchain and works with any ERC20 compatible token. The Raiden project is work in progress. Its goal is to research state channel technology, define protocols and develop reference implementations. Technology The Raiden Network is an infrastructure layer on top of the Ethereum blockchain. While the basic idea is simple, the underlying protocol is quite complex and the implementation non-trivial. Nonetheless the technicalities can be abstracted away, such that developers can interface with a rather simple API to build scalable decentralized applications based on the Raiden Network. THE PROBLEM . Blockchains don\u2019t scale well because there needs to be global consensus on the order and outcome of all transfers. Every participant needs to learn about all updates to the shared ledger. Hardware and bandwidth constraints set a limit on the number of updates per second that can be shared in a decentralized network. RAIDEN NETWORK 101. The basic idea of the Raiden Network is to avoid the blockchain consensus bottleneck. This is done by leveraging a network of payment channels which allow to securely transfer value off-chain, i.e without involving the blockchain for every transfer. To learn more, read the Raiden Network 101, take a look at the current specification or check out the code. SCALABLE Scales linearly with the number of participants FAST Transfers can be confirmed within a subsecond PRIVATE Individual transfers don\u2019t show up in the global shared ledger INTEROPERABLE Works with any token that follows Ethereum\u2019s standardized token API (ERC20) LOW FEES Transfer fees can be orders of magnitude lower than on the blockchain MICROPAYMENTS Low transaction fees allow to efficiently transfer tiny values Use cases . RETAIL PAYMENTS There are quite a few high profile Ethereum token based projects competing to bring blockchain based payments to the masses. Especially in developing countries these efforts may potentially improve the life of millions. The Raiden Network can be a crucial building block, as significant adoption relies on scalable technology and competitive fees. . P2P CASH Cash as we know it is on the retreat as there is a trend towards cashless societies. Scalable blockchain based payments can help to preserve the private and decentralized nature of cash while updating its user experience to the expectations of a new generation. . MICROPAYMENTS Blockchains are a hot candidate to become the payment infrastructure of the upcoming machine-to-machine economy. IoT may increase the number of commercial transactions by an order of magnitude and the cheaper the cost of transfers become, the more use cases emerge. Micropayments can be used to get fine grained access to APIs, bandwidth, computing power, storage, electricity, basically any infrastructure. The same goes for content or entertainment such as webpages, gaming, video or audio streaming. Already today many proposed DApps rely on tiny payments between participants in the network to incentivise cooperative behaviour. . INSTANT TOKEN SWAPS Next to payments, the exchange of tokens is probably the second most prominent use case of blockchains. This is even more so the case, if the current trend of tokenization continues. Decentralized exchanges built on Raiden Network\u2019s atomic token swaps feature allow to instantly exchange tokens at low cost. .footer { background: black; color: white; } .footer .container { width: 90%; } .footer a { font-size: 15px; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.55; text-align: left; color: #ffffff; display: block; } .footer a:hover { opacity: 0.5; } .footer-title { font-size: 15px; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.55; text-align: left; color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.6px; } .footer-box { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; padding: 0!important; } .footer-box div { padding: 0 10px; } .blog-link { margin-bottom: 30px; } Latest blog post View RSS feed Development Raiden Network Github Raiden Network Docs \u00b5Raiden Github \u00b5Raiden Docs Explorer Community Twitter Blog Reddit Youtube Dev chat Organization We're hiring!

It comes as a set of open source libraries, documentation, and code examples for multiple use cases. Whereas its big brother the Raiden Network aims to allow for multihop transfers via a network of bidirectional payment channels, \u00b5Raiden already now enables to make micropayments through unidirectional payment channels. Status \u00b5Raiden is live on the Ethereum mainnet. Find the latest release on github. Join in by contributing to our open source code base, or implement \u00b5Raiden in your DApp! Built on \u00b5Raiden Business models involving frequent payments between the client and the service provider are not efficiently possible on current blockchains due to slow confirmation times and high transaction fees. Using \u00b5Raiden, service providers can comfortably charge per-use of for example APIs, digital content and utilities via micropayments in Ethereum based tokens. . IOT MARKETS Machines can also be customers in machine-to-machine markets. We do not discriminate. The increasing demand for IoT or more general M2M (machine-to-machine) applications is evident in today's industry. Utilities, data storage, data usage, XaaS services, and APIs are all services that usually offer rate limits or subscription models because charging on a per-use basis is infeasible. With \u00b5Raiden, per-use charging finally becomes possible. . PAY PER USE Micropayments are becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to intrusive advertisement and subscription walls. \u00b5Raiden gives users the option to decide on a pay-per-use basis whether they would rather endure ads or pay for a premium experience. Customers would not need to engage in the commitment of a monthly subscription model. FAQ How does \u00b5Raiden compare to the Raiden Network? \u00b5Raiden supports efficient off-chain token transfers to predetermined receivers (many-to-one). \u00b5Raiden uses the Raiden Network's most basic building block, namely payment channels, and turns them into an easy to use off-the-shelf system. \u00b5Raiden is cheaper, simpler to use, and more specialized to a smaller range of applications. \u00b5Raiden does not support multihop transfer fees, and therefore only allows to send tokens unidirectionally to predetermined receivers. The Raiden Network will remove this limitation and allow to transfer tokens between any two parties in the Raiden Network. What fees are there? In \u00b5Raiden, off-chain transfers cost ZERO fees. Only opening and closing payment channels incur standard Ethereum gas fees. How secure is \u00b5Raiden? \u00b5Raiden relies on Ethereum's own security. Only the sender and receiver, identified by their respective private keys, are able to interact with their channel, both on-chain and off-chain. How can I setup a \u00b5Raiden application?

Below you find already implemented and future features and enhancements to the protocol. You can follow more detailed updates on the development progress in the weekly GitHub activity summaries on Reddit and on the Raiden Blog. The roadmap presents major features and components integrated up to and including the Ithaca milestone. Please note that this roadmap doesn\u2019t imply any guarantees or promises on future development items but should rather be seen as one envisaged path that could be taken by the Raiden project. What (Feauture \/ Component) Status \u00b5Raiden - unidirectional many-to-one payment channels \u00b5Raiden is the first stepping stone towards the full Raiden Network. It's a payment channel framework for frequent, fast and free ERC20-token-based micropayments between two parties. These payment channels are unidirectional and many-to-one. Live on main net since 01.12.2017 Opening, closing and settlement of payment channels including single and multi-hop transfers Core functionalities of the payment channel network: Users can open, close and settle payment channels with multiple parties. Users can send tokens directly to the recipient using an open channel as well as sending payments to a third party with no direct connection by routing the payment via other payment channels. Included in Raiden testnet releases Raiden REST API REST API with endpoints for all functionalities. The API enables dApp developers to easily build applications using the Raiden Network. Included in Raiden testnet releases WebUI Graphical interface to use the basic functionalities of the Raiden Network built on the API. Included in Raiden testnet releases Routing 1.0 A multi-hop transfer can be conducted using the routing 1.0 algorithm. However, this might not be the most efficient route since there is only a local view of channel balances. Included in Raiden testnet releases Channel top up Topping up the balance of existing payment channels by sending tokens into escrow. This is an on-chain transaction. Included in Raiden testnet releases Automatically joining a token network and connecting to peers Raiden supports first time users and simplifies usage by automatically joining token networks of the respective tokens held by connecting to peers and opening channels with them. Included in Raiden testnet releases Refactored smart contracts Contracts were optimized for gas by using one contract per token network. Additionally, locks can now be unlocked in a single transaction batch. Finally, thanks to the Secret Registry contract, we achieve constant time lock expiration. Included in Raiden testnet releases Reliable transport layer The Raiden Network is using Matrix as the transport protocol for exchanging messages between the Raiden nodes. Included in Raiden testnet releases Recoverability Recoverability is ensured in case of an irregular shutdown of the Raiden node. This feature is crucial to prevent the loss of data in case a Raiden node shuts down unexpectedly (e.g. due to a power outage). Included in Raiden testnet releases Raiden Network Explorer (status page) The Raiden Network Explorer gives an overview of network statistics and visualizes the live status of the payment channel networks. Live: explorer.raiden.network Red Eyes Release on Mainnet The alpha testing version of the Raiden Network containing all above features on the Ethereum Mainnet with safety limits: Total maximum value (sum of all channel deposits) contained in smart contract: 250 ETH Limited to one token network: WETH (wrapped Ether) Maximum deposit in each payment channel: 0.15 ETH (0.075 per direction\/node) One-time use Deprecation Switch Read more about the implemented safety measures of Red Eyes here. Live: Release v0.100.1 \u201cRed Eyes\u201d Channel withdraw This function enables users to withdraw funds from open payment channels without the need to close them. Future Atomic Token Swaps Allow to atomically exchange tokens off-chain. This can be used to build state channel based decentralized exchanges on top. Future Cooperative Settle With a cooperative settlement of a payment channel, less on-chain transactions are required. Hence, if two parties agree on a cooperative settlement of their channel, the closing of the channel is cheaper. Future Fee model for channel balancing Balanced channels maximise the odds to facilitate transfers throughout the network. By setting fees for mediating transfers, nodes can incentivise the balancing of their channels. Future Raiden Service Bundle The Raiden Service Bundle (RSB) will enable third parties to offer services like pathfinding and monitoring to users. Future Pathfinding services As part of the RSB, pathfinding services will support users in finding the cheapest way to route a payment. Future Monitoring services As part of the RSB, monitoring services will watch a users channel when he is not online. In case one of the channels gets closed, the monitoring service can properly close and settle on behalf of the user.

The 100 Million tokens are a cryptocurrency based on Ethereum, designed to be a general purpose, decentralised cryptocurrency. The currency can already be used for micropayments on \u00b5Raiden and is envisaged to become compatible with and to be used on the Raiden Network. FAQ What are RDN tokens and what can I do with them? The project token (RDN) is a general purpose, decentralised cryptocurrency envisaged to be compatible with and used on the Raiden Network. It can be used to in micropayment channels on \u00b5Raiden, which is currently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet at 0x1440317CB15499083dEE3dDf49C2bD51D0d92e33 and perform payments over these channels. For more information on the RDN token, review the token contracts or see this blogpost. What was the initial allocation of RDN tokens? A total (fixed) supply of 100,000,000 tokens were generated, which were allocated as follows: 50% Public auction 34% Retained by brainbot labs Establishment (Raiden project lead) 16% External development fund Learn more about the initial allocation of RDN tokens in this blogpost.

What is Raiden? Raiden is an open source project that aims to scale Ethereum by using state channel technology. . What is the Raiden Network? The Raiden Network is an off-chain transfer network for Ethereum ERC20 tokens. It provides a fast, scalable, and cheap alternative to on-chain token transfers. At the same time, Raiden Network transfers provide users with guarantees of finality, security, and decentralization similar to those known from blockchains. . Which problems does the Raiden Network solve? The Raiden Network is a technology that leverages off-chain payment channel networks to address these substantial issues on the Ethereum blockchain: Scalability Blockchains do not scale well. Current public, permissionless blockchains are unable to achieve more than a low, fixed number of transactions per second. Ethereum has been shown to reach its cap at about 10 transactions per second. Short-term scaling solutions, like raising maximum computation performed per block by a constant factor, will not be able to support continued mainstream adoption. The Raiden Network will provide a payment system based on payment channel technology that scales with the number of its users. This means that the bigger the Raiden Network becomes, the higher its maximum throughput will be, with practically no upper limit in sight. Latency Blockchains are slow. At the moment, Ethereum mines a new block approximately every 15 to 30 seconds. To reach practical finality of a transaction, confirmation times of several minutes have to be endured. This significantly degrades user experience and hinders mainstream adoption. Raiden Network transfers are as fast as text messages. The moment you receive a signed Raiden transfer, you can be certain that you now hold the amount included in the transfer. There is no need to wait for any confirmations. Transaction fees Using blockchains is expensive. Once a blockchain hits its limit, paying high enough fees to be included in a block becomes a competitive endeavor, as is the case with Bitcoin today. Ethereum will be no different, eventually leading to even higher confirmation times and transaction fees on the order of a few dollars per transaction. For the vision of a global, decentralized, and dependable computer this is highly detrimental. Raiden Network transfer fees will be several orders of magnitude lower than on-chain transaction fees. Instead of paying for global consensus, you only pay for forwarding peer-to-peer consensus. Low fees allow for a long tail of new use cases which have not been practical before due to high transaction costs. Especially IoT and the Machine-to-Machine economy depend on being able to transfer tiny values. Raiden aims to be the predominant payment layer for these applications. Improving privacy Ethereum transactions are public, whereas Raiden transfers will be private between the payer, the payee, and the nodes forwarding the transfer. When channels are settled, only the sum of transactions will become visible to the entire world. . What is \u03bcRaiden? \u03bcRaiden (Micro Raiden) shares some properties with the Raiden Network. It can provide trustless, instant and free transfers between two parties. It is intended for many-to-one payment setups, like users interacting with a Dapp. However, it is not suitable for many-to-many payment setups as it requires users to lock up tokens upfront for every potential payee. This limitation comes with reduced technological complexity, allowing \u00b5Raiden to be used on the mainnet today. . ELI5, how does the Raiden Network work? If you think of a blockchain as a universally trusted but very slow bank that charges you for wire transfers, then the Raiden Network offers checks that will never bounce back when cashed at that bank. Once you receive a Raiden check from someone, you can be absolutely certain that this check is real and that you are now richer than you were moments ago. But neither you nor your payer had to stand in line at the bank or wait for the clerk to perform a wire transfer. You can decide to cash this check at the bank at any time, potentially with hundreds and thousands of other checks simultaneously and you only need to pay fees once when turning all of these checks in. If your payer had instead made a single wire transfer per payment, he would have paid a lot more in fees and both of you would have waited a lot longer for a confirmation. As a side-effect, the bank is happy too because this system significantly reduces internal workload. What's more, you don't even need to be in contact with the person that wants to give you a check. It is entirely sufficient if you know someone who knows someone who eventually knows someone that knows this other person. They all pass checks on to each other until one finally reaches you. But all of them are only valid if you confirm to everyone that you have received yours in the end. The Raiden Network will take care of connecting you and your partner through this network of bank customers and will make sure that all checks are as binding as actually visiting the blockchain bank for a transfer. . What is a payment channel? Payment channels are a technology that enables off-chain transfers of on-chain tokens. This works by first depositing the tokens in a payment channel contract. Then, transfers can be performed by sending signed messages directly between two parties without any involvement of the blockchain itself. Therefore, transaction frequency is only limited by the hardware of sender and receiver. But best of all, there are literally no transaction fees, other than for a one-time on-chain deposit and eventual settlement. Since only the two participants have access to the deposit in the payment channel's smart contract, payment channel transfers are immune to double-spending attacks, making them as secure as on-chain transactions. . Why is the Raiden Network a network? For every payment channel, tokens have to be deposited and are subsequently locked for the lifetime of the channel. It is easy to see that this makes opening payment channels with everyone infeasible: A huge amount of tokens would be required. Instead, Raiden creates a network connecting all participants transitively through routes of payment channels. As long as there exists a route connecting payer and payee, the Raiden Network will enable token transfers just as if they were directly connected. This way, every participant only has to open a few channels, but will still able to transfer to any other peer. State & Vision . What is the status of the Raiden project? Raiden currently consists of two phases of development: \u00b5Raiden and the Raiden Network. There is a working implementation of \u00b5Raiden, which supports a subset of the functionality of the Raiden Network and is currently live on the Ethereum mainnet. The Raiden Network is still in development. You can find the latest status of Raiden's development here. and deploy the latest version of the software here. On a more general note, you can always check the current state of development at our GitHub. . Will the Raiden Network actually work? The Raiden Network already works in its current state. Transfers can be sent instantly to any participant in the network using a simple routing mechanism and intermediate transfers. We are, however, aware of criticism surrounding the idea of networks like Lightning and Raiden. We want to address some of the most common ones here. \"Routing cannot be performed efficiently.\" Scalable Routing is indeed one of the biggest issues of payment channel networks. There is a trade-off between centralization, privacy, and efficiency. Simulations have shown that our approach of combining a Kademlia-like structured network with a federation of path finding helpers allows for efficient and scalable path finding while preserving decentralization and privacy. \"Intermediate transfers create a bottleneck on liquidity due to locked up tokens.\" This is not the case. While it is true that for the duration of a Raiden transfer, intermediate tokens are locked up and cannot be used elsewhere, this has no noticeable effect on network liquidity. The time it takes for a transfer to be completed is on the order of tenths of a second with configurable timeouts to account for failing nodes. When you decide to forward a transfer, it will be a matter of at most a few seconds to regain control over your locked up tokens. Additionally, as long as you have enough tokens deposited in your channel, you can forward multiple transfers at the same time. Each node can forward many transfers per second, depending on their deposits. \"The Raiden Network cannot support large transfers.\" This is partially true. The Raiden Network is not intended to support large value transfers. A Raiden transfer requires each channel on a route through the network to be able to relay the desired amount. The bigger a transfer, the lower the probability that there is a route of channels, each of which is able to support the transfer. Currently, we recommend to perform large-scale transfers on-chain. In the future, large transfers might simply be split up over multiple channels. \"Natural wealth distribution will cause a centralized network.\" It is true that larger nodes will relay significantly more transfers than smaller nodes, having more channels and higher deposits. However, intermediary nodes cannot cheat, no matter how big they are. Nor do bigger nodes prevent smaller ones from participating in the network. The moment nodes stop accepting or forwarding transfers is the moment they stop being nodes to the rest of the network. It might very well be possible that wealthy institutions provide large transfer hubs to make a profit on transfer fees but this will only support the network with liquidity and competitive fees, not endanger its decentralization. \"Channels degrade over time.\" This is only true in a naive system design. Without further systems in place, channels will become imbalanced over time. However, channels can be automatically rebalanced through proper incentivization. Nodes can adjust their forwarding fees in such a way that their channels remain balanced. Our simulations show that this alone helps to prolong channel longevity by a great deal. \"Nodes may become unresponsive.\" This is entirely expected and is an issue that is handled gracefully in just about any modern peer-to-peer protocol. The Raiden Network is no exception. Nodes going offline will cause the Raiden Network to route transfers around that node within milliseconds. While the network itself is resilient against unresponsive nodes, individual participants could be attacked if they go offline: Their channels may be closed fraudulently, requiring challenges that they would be unable to submit. For this reason, payment channels have challenge periods, meaning that down times would not directly allow for an attack. Additionally, third parties providing a challenging service will ensure that participants can safely go offline. Fees . Are there fees in the Raiden Network? Yes, there are two kinds of fees in the Raiden Network: Protocol level fees Peripheral fees Protocol level fees are necessary to keep the payment channel network balanced. Nodes will use fees to prevent their channels from being depleted over time. These fees will be comparatively small and be denominated in the token that is transferred in the channel. Peripheral fees will be payable to services in the network that, for example, assist with finding a path with sufficient capacity or services that provide channel monitoring services for offline users. Users running these services themselves will not need to pay these fees but can earn them instead. It is assumed that >95% of all nodes on the network will be light-clients happy to pay tiny fees for the convenience of not having to run the full stack of services. . Will there be a Raiden Network token? Yes, peripheral services will be paid for in RDN tokens, a virtual currency dedicated to pay for services within the Raiden Network. Note that this token is not at the core of the protocol and only used by participants who opt to pay for the convenience of not having to run a full node. . Is the Raiden Network spam-resistant? Yes, spamming a single node does not harm the network as a whole. Nodes throttle their connections and will disconnect spammers. Other Questions . Can ETH be transferred over the Raiden Network? Yes. While ETH currently does not qualify as an ERC20 token, simple wrapper contracts exist that allow ETH to be treated just like an ERC20 token. . Why does the Raiden Network support ERC20 tokens rather than native Ether? Making the Raiden Network compatible with ERC20 tokens allows many different token networks to be created and thus, many different token transfers to be compiled using the Raiden Network. Supporting ERC20 tokens enables the network to possibly support atomic swaps in the future, too. When wrapped into an ERC20 token, native Ether can be added as well. . Is there a white paper? Unfortunately not yet. We have been busy researching and developing the software. But a protocol specification is in the making and at some point the final design will be presented in a white paper. . Who is developing Raiden? Raiden is developed by brainbot, a company deeply committed to the Ethereum ecosystem. Comparison to other projects . How is it different from the Lightning Network? The Raiden Network is very similar to the Lightning Network. In contrast to the Lightning Network, the Raiden Network supports all ERC20 tokens instead of being limited to the transfer of BTCs. . How is it different from Sharding? Sharding will allow Ethereum to significantly scale overall transaction capacity, basically by partitioning state over multiple chains. It\u2019s a very important and needed improvement which is complementary to the Raiden Network. While sharding helps to scale, it will still have suboptimal latency, cost and privacy properties for token transfers, compared to the Raiden Network. In order to scale token transfer capacity using shards, cross-shard communication is necessary, which is expected to be even slower and similarly expensive as transfers on Ethereum. While sharding is important, it is not an optimal solution for token transfers. . How is it different from Plasma? Plasma is a proposed concept to scale transaction capacity using hierarchical trees of side chains. Similar to sharding, it will not be able to provide the latency and low fee properties as provided by the Raiden Network. Implementations of Plasma will be complementary to the Raiden Network. . How is it different from IOTA\u2019s tangle? Tangles are a new, interesting technology. Some aspects of them, however, are not clear. Concerning token transfers, current implementations of tangles require a lot of computational resources because transaction mining and validation are combined into a single process. This makes them largely unfit for less powerful systems such as smartphones or IoT devices. In contrast, Raiden transfers are quick to create, requiring only a single elliptic curve signature to be computed. . How is the project related to the RaidEX decentralized exchange? RaidEX is a Proof-of-Concept of a decentralized exchange built on top the Raiden Network based on its atomic token swap feature. . How is the project related to the Trustlines Network? The Trustlines Network implements the original Ripple idea on Ethereum. Both projects are based on the idea of channel networks and are complementary. At some point, Trustlines could be built on top of the Raiden Network. . Can the Raiden Network be used with other blockchains? Blockchains supporting the Ethereum Virtual Machine will be able to use the Raiden Network after manual modification to work with their API. While this is not a focus of current development, it is reasonable to expect the Raiden Network to work with Polkadot, Dfinitiy, Cosmo, Hyperledger Burrow, EOS and others."},{"url":"http:\/\/raidennetwork.ow\/privacy.html","title":"Raiden Network","text":"url:raidennetwork.ow\/privacy.html .brand-logo img { height: 40px; margin: 12px 0; } .bug-bounty-btn { border-radius: 11.5px; box-shadow: 0 0 1.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16); background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #90e9fa, #00d4ff); color: white; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 2.2; text-align: left; color: #ffffff; border-radius: 40px; margin: 0 15px; } #bounty-modal p { text-align: center; color: black; } .sidenav-overlay { z-index: 900 !important; } menu Bug bounty Explorer Raiden 101 \u00b5Raiden Roadmap Token FAQ Bug bounty Explorer Raiden 101 \u00b5Raiden Roadmap Token FAQ Privacy Policy This Privacy Policy describes how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by Brainbot Labs Est.

DApps Platform, Inc. (\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) provides its services through its website located at trustwalletapp.com and related mobile applications and products (collectively the \u201cServices\u201d or \u201cTrust Wallet\u201d). Before using our Services, please read the Terms of Service (the \u201cTerms\u201d or the \u201cAgreement\u201d) carefully, along with any other policies or notices on Trust Wallet\u2019s website or mobile applications, and our Privacy Policy located at https:\/\/trustwalletapp.com\/privacy-policy.html. Together, these materials contain terms, rules, and guidelines related to your use of Trust Wallet.OVERVIEWWe know that Terms can be long and confusing, so we will do our best to keep things as clear and concise as possible. This section provides a brief summary of the highlights of this Agreement. Please note that when you accept this Agreement, you are accepting all of the terms and conditions and not just this section.Trust Wallet provides self-hosted wallet services for Ethereum-based blockchains.By creating or importing a wallet, downloading or running our mobile application, or visiting our website, you are agreeing to our Terms, so please read carefully.These terms outline approved uses of Trust Wallet, various licenses that we grant to you, and licenses that you grant us.If you have any questions or comments related to this Agreement, please send us a message on our website at [email protected] or contact us through Discord, Facebook, Telegram, or Twitter.If you do not agree to this Agreement or any modifications to this Agreement, you should not use our Services.HOW YOU ACCEPT THIS POLICYBy creating or importing a locally hosted wallet (a \u201cWallet\u201d), or visiting our website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms, as well as the accompanying Privacy Policy located at https:\/\/trustwalletapp.com\/privacy-policy.html. We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time. Any such changes with respect to your use of Trust Wallet will take effect immediately when posted on our website or on our mobile application. Your continued use of Trust Wallet following any such change will signify your acceptance to be bound by the then current Terms. Please check the effective date above to determine if there have been any changes since you have last reviewed these Terms. If you do not agree to this Agreement or any modifications to this Agreement, you should not use Trust Wallet. Failure or delay by Trust Wallet in enforcing or partially enforcing any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights.ELIGIBILITYTo be eligible to use Trust Wallet, you must be at least eighteen (18) years old and be able to form legally binding contracts. If you are using our Services on behalf of a legal entity, you further represent and warrant that: (a) the legal entity is duly organized and validly existing under the applicable laws of the jurisdiction of its organization; and (b) you are duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its behalf. You can only use our Services if permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction. Please make sure that these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations that apply to you. By using Trust Wallet, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements that we outline in these Terms. We may still refuse to let certain people access or use Trust Wallet, however, and we reserve the right to change our eligibility criteria at any time.THE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICESTrust Wallet is software that (a) generates Wallet addresses and encrypted private keys that you may use to send and receive Ethereum and related cryptographically secured tokens (the \u201cVirtual Currency\u201d); (b) allows users to browse third party decentralized applications (\u201cDApps\u201d or \u201cDApp\u201d) through the mobile application\u2019s DApp browser; and (c) facilitates the submission of Virtual Currency transaction data to Ethereum-based blockchains (the \u201cEthereum Networks\u201d) without requiring you to download or install the associated Ethereum-based software to your local device. Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities. An encrypted backup of certain information associated with the Wallet can be stored on your device in Keystore JSON format. The private key is connected to the Wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Virtual Currency to and from that Wallet address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. You must keep your Wallet address, mnemonic (backup) phrase, and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated with the Wallet. Trust Wallet Cannot Assist With Password Retrieval. Trust Wallet stores your Wallet address but does not receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Virtual Currency you have associated with such a Wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password. Virtual Currency Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency\u2019s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the Ethereum Networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using Trust Wallet, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Ethereum Networks. Trust Wallet Does Not Store or Transmit Virtual Currency. We do not store, send, or receive Virtual Currency. Any transfer that occurs in any Virtual Currency occurs on the Ethereum-based blockchains and not on a network owned by us. We therefore do not guarantee that Trust Wallet can affect the transfer of title or right in any Virtual Currency. Accuracy of Information Provided by User. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Virtual Currency transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Virtual Currency.WALLET REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT INFORMATIONYou must either import or create a Wallet in order to use Trust Wallet. When you create a Wallet, you will be assigned a private key. You will be prompted to download and save a keystore - your private key encrypted with a password. You will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your private key and keystore, and will be fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password, account, or any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph. When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and\/or control over your Wallet. \u00a0Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) creating a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) using the backup functionality provided by the Wallet or safeguard your private key and mnemonic (backup) phrase on an external hard drive which, all users, especially users who have more than $100,000 USD in assets, are encouraged to do even if they are utilizing the Services\u2019 backup functionality; (c) maintaining the security of your Wallet by protecting the private key and mnemonic (backup)\u00a0phrase associated with your Wallet by, for example, limiting access to your computer and your Wallet; and (d) promptly notifying us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet. Push Notifications. You may agree to receive push notifications from Trust Wallet that will alert you when Ethereum-based blockchains are congested and when transactions involving your Wallet have been completed. Push notifications can be enabled to display information about Token Launches.\u00a0If you would like to receive push notifications, you must opt in to the service by accessing \u201cSettings\u201d and enabling \u201cPush Notifications\u201d. Payment and Fees. Trust Wallet does not currently charge any fees for any of its Services. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future and, in such case, any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any service to which a fee applies. Transactions. Once transaction details have been submitted via the Services, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. Trust Wallet has no control over any Ethereum-based blockchain and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and\/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your Trust Wallet account. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you have submitted transaction details for via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Ethereum-based transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Virtual Currency-related transactions.THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND CONTENTIn no event shall a description or reference to a third party\u2019s product or service (including, but not limited to, providing a description or reference via hyperlink) be construed as an endorsement or promotion of such third party products or services by us. We retain the exclusive right to add to, modify, or cancel the availability of any Third Party Service. You may agree to receive push notifications from Third Party Content providers. In order to receive push notifications, you must opt in to the service. Push notifications will not be automatically enabled on your device for Third Party Content. We do not control, endorse, or adopt any Third Party Content shared through push notifications, and will have no responsibility for Third Party Content including, but not limited to, token availability and\/or sales. If, to the extent permitted by Trust Wallet, you grant express permission to a third party to access or connect to your Trust Wallet account, either through the third party\u2019s product or service or through Trust Wallet, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement. You are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any third party with access to your Trust Wallet account.\u200dBuy with Credit Card.

We do our best not to collect any Personal Information from Trust Wallet users. \u00a0That being said, when using our Services, we do collect PUBlIC wallet addresses that you generate through Trust Wallet. Further, we may collect some Personal Information from you when you communicate with us, including your contact information, such as your phone number, social media handle, or email address (depending on how you reach out). Like other online services, we also collect a variety of Non-Personal Information, including:Information you create through the Trust Wallet\u2019s website or mobile applications, including public wallet addresses.Various analytics data, such as: (i) the IP address of the computer you use to access Trust Wallet; (ii) the type of browser software you are using; (iii) the operating system you are using; (iv) the date and time you access or use Trust Wallet; (v) the website address, if any, that linked you to Trust Wallet; (vi) the website address, if any, you leave our website and travel to; and (vii) other non-personally identifiable traffic data.HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATIONWhen You Contact Us.

Your IP address will not be used to track or identify you, but may be used to determine your geographic location in order to determine which of our services you are presented with. Users of our website or mobile applications will receive an anonymous unique device id (\u201cUDID\u201d) for the purpose of identifying the device to Trust Wallet servers. This UDID will not be tied to users\u2019 identities, but will be used for debugging purposes and to differentiate devices when users access our Services using multiple devices. Third Party Services Certain features on Trust Wallet rely on various third-party products and services (collectively \u201cThird Party Services\u201d), such as the Ethereum network, Google Analytics, Apple\u2019s application platform, Coinbase, Changelly, Fabric, and Shapeshift.

Any information that you provide to us is done so entirely at your own risk.CHILDRENWe are especially sensitive about children\u2019s information. Our Services are not targeted towards children, and we don\u2019t knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, we will treat any information that you provide us while using Trust Wallet on behalf of your minor child as Personal Information as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions concerning our information practices with respect to children, or if you learn that a child under the age of 13 has used Trust Wallet, created a user account, or provided us with personal information, please email us at [email protected]ONLINE TRACKING AND HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALSOnline tracking is the collection of data about an individual\u2019s Internet activity used to deliver targeted advertisements and for other purposes. Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his\/her online activity and behavior tracked. If an online service elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the service may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser\u2019s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website operators, including Trust Wallet, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit http:\/\/allaboutdnt.com.CHANGES AND UPDATES TO PRIVACY POLICYWe reserve the right to update and revise this privacy policy at any time. \u00a0We occasionally review this Privacy Policy to make sure it complies with applicable laws and conforms to changes in our business.
