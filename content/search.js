Please take some time to understand this for your own safety. \ud83d\ude4f Your funds will be stolen if you do not head these warnings. We cannot recover your funds or freeze your account if you visit a phishing site or lose your private key. What is MEW? MyEtherWallet is a free, open-source, client-side interface. We allow you to interact directly with the blockchain while remaining in full control of your keys & your funds. **You** and **only you** are responsible for your security. MyEtherWallet is not a Bank MyEtherWallet is not a Bank When you open an account with a bank or exchange, they create an account for you in their system. They keep track of your personal information, account passwords, balances, transactions and ultimately your money. They charge fees to manage your account and provide services, like refunding transactions when your card gets stolen. You can write a check or charge your debit card to send money, go online to check your balance, reset your password, and get a new debit card if you lose it. You have an account *with the bank* and they decide how much money you can send, where you can send it, and how long to hold on a suspicious deposit. All for a fee. Introduction MyEtherWallet is an Interface MyEtherWallet is an Interface When you create an account here, you are generating an cryptographic set of numbers: your private key and your public key (address). The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser. We never transmit, receive or store your private key, password, or other account information. We do not charge a transaction fee. You are just using our **interface** to interact **directly with the blockchain**. If you send your *public key (address)* to someone, they can send you ETH or tokens. \ud83d\udc4d If you send your *private key* to someone, they now have full control of your account. \ud83d\udc4e MEW isn't a Bank WTF is a Blockchain? I already know what a blockchain is... Wait, WTF is a Blockchain? The blockchain is like a huge, global, decentralized spreadsheet. It keeps track of who sent how many coins to whom, and what the balance of every account is. It is stored and maintained by thousands of people (miners) across the globe who have special computers. It is made up of all the individual transactions sent from MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Exodus, Mist, Geth, Parity, and everywhere else. When you see your balance on MyEtherWallet.com or view your transactions on [etherscan.io](https:\/\/etherscan.io), you are seeing data on the blockchain, not in our personal systems. Again: we are not a bank. MEW is an Interface But...why does this matter? Why are you making me read all this? Because we need you to understand that we **cannot**... Access your account or send your funds for you. Recover or change your private key. Recover or reset your password. Reverse, cancel, or refund transactions. Freeze accounts. **You** and **only you** are responsible for your security. Be diligent to keep your private key and password safe. Your private key is sometimes called your mnemonic phrase, keystore file, UTC file, JSON file, wallet file. If lose your private key or password, no one can recover it. If you enter your private key on a phishing website, you will have **all your funds taken**. WTF is a Blockchain? What's the Point of MEW then? If MyEtherWallet can't do those things, what's the point? Because that is the point of decentralization and the blockchain. You don't have to rely on your bank, government, or anyone else when you want to move your funds. You don't have to rely on the security of an exchange or bank to keep your funds safe. If you don't find these things valuable, ask yourself why you think the blockchain and cryptocurrencies are valuable. \ud83d\ude09 If you don't like the sound of this, consider using [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) or [Blockchain.info](https:\/\/blockchain.info\/wallet\/#\/signup). They have more familiar accounts with usernames & passwords. If you are scared but want to use MEW, [get a hardware wallet](https:\/\/kb.myetherwallet.com\/hardware-wallets\/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html)! These keep your keys secure. But...why? How To Protect Yourself & Your Funds How To Protect Yourself from Phishers Phishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyEtherWallet, EtherDelta, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.

If it is too good to be true, it probably is. Research before sending money to someone or some project. Look for information on a variety of websites and forums. Be wary. Ask questions when you don't understand something or it doesn't seem right. Don't let fear, FUD, or FOMO win over common sense. If something is very urgent, ask yourself 'why?'. It may be to create FOMO or prevent you from doing research. Phuck Phishers How To Protect Yourself from Loss How To Protect Yourself from Loss If you lose your private key or password, it is gone forever. Don't lose it. Make a backup of your private key and password. Do NOT just store it on your computer. Print it out on a piece of paper or save it to a USB drive. Store this paper or USB drive in a different physical location. A backup is not useful if it is destroyed by a fire or flood along with your laptop. Do not store your private key in Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud storage. If that account is compromised, your funds will be stolen.
